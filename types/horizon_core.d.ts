 * The functionality of an entity is provided by its attached

 *
 * The most common way for script to access an entity is by using
 * `this.entity`, which refers to the entity the current component
 * instance is attached to. Another common way is for the script to cast
 * an entity as a gizmo, such as {@link TextGizmo}.
 *
 * Scripts can also interact with external entities in the following ways:
 *
 * Entity panel: If the Entity Panel of the attached entity passes in
 * entities as properties.
 *
 * Events: If an entity is sent to a script using an event, such as
 * a {@link CodeBlockEvent}.
 *
 * Spawned entities: Entities that are spawned into the world. See the
 * {@link https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/desktop-editor/assets/asset-spawning-reference | Asset Spawning}
 * guide for usage.

 * For information about using entities, see the
 * {@link https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/getting-started/typescript-components-properties-and-variables#entity | TypeScript Components, Properties, and Variables}
 * guide.
 *
 * @example

 * ```
 * import {TextGizmo} from 'horizon/core';
 *
 * const textHint = entity.as(TextGizmo);
 * textHint.text.set('Aim here');
 * ```
 *
 * @example

/**
 * The core class for creating new types of components and attaching
 * functionality to {@link Entity | entities} in a world.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The `Component` class is an abstract class that you can extend to create new
 * types of components that add properties and functionality to entities in your
 * world. It provides properties and methods that manage the lifecycle of
 * components, their relationship with attached entities, internal component
 * data, and access to events including code block events.
 *
 * When you create a new component in Desktop Editor, the editor generates a
 * script that includes the following elements:
 *
 * {@link Component.propsDefinition} - Defines internal properties for the
 * class, which are also
 * added to the Properties panel in Desktop Editor.
 *
 * {@link Component.start} - The method that executes when the class initially
 * loads. This is where you can add event listeners that need to run when the
 * script starts running.
 *
 * {@link Component.register} - The method that registers the new component class as a
 * component definition that can be used to generate instances of the component
 * in your world.
 *
 * For more information about using components, see the
 * {@link https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/tutorials/tutorial-worlds/intro-to-desktop-editor-and-typescript/module-2-intro-to-scripting | Intro to Scripting}
 * tutorial, and the
 * {@link https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/typescript/getting-started/typescript-components-properties-and-variables | TypeScript Components, Properties, and Variables}
 * guide.
 *
 * @example
 * In the following example, the NpcItem class extends the Component class
 * to define a new type of component. The new component type is then registered
 * so new instances of the NpcItem can be created in the world.
 * ```
 * import * as hz from 'horizon/core';
 *
 * class NpcItem extends hz.Component<typeof NpcItem> {
 *   static propsDefinition = {};
 *
 *   start() {}
 * }
 * hz.Component.register(NpcItem);
